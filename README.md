# Minesweeper

> A clone of a classic.

I think Minesweeper is a strong contender for the best piece of software Microsoft ever wrote. This
is my take on the classic.

It uses vanilla ES2016+ and CSS, and is built of rough components. Its architecture is likely
inspired by recent work of mine with Vue.js.
